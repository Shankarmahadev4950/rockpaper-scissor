This modern take on the classic Rock Paper Scissors game combines nostalgic gameplay with cutting-edge web design. The game features vibrant neon aesthetics, smooth 3D animations, and a sleek glassmorphism interface that creates an immersive gaming experience. Designed with attention to detail, it offers both visual appeal and responsive performance across all devices.

The game boasts several impressive visual and interactive elements. The neon glow effects and animated gradient borders give it a futuristic arcade feel, while the glass-like UI elements with backdrop blur create depth and sophistication. Each choice button (rock, paper, scissors) has its own distinctive neon color (blue, pink, green) with dynamic hover effects.

Gameplay animations bring the experience to life. When players make their selection, 3D hand models perform a dramatic shake before revealing the outcome. The VS separator between hands features glassmorphism styling, and scores animate with a pulse effect when updated. These polished animations provide satisfying visual feedback for every move.

Built using fundamental web technologies, this project demonstrates modern front-end capabilities. The structure relies on clean HTML5, while CSS3 handles the advanced styling including complex animations, gradients, and the glassmorphism effect. JavaScript powers the game logic and interactivity, with Google's Montserrat font providing professional typography.

Playing is simple and intuitive. Users select their move by clicking one of three clearly marked buttons. The computer instantly responds with its choice through an engaging animation sequence. The game clearly displays who wins each round while maintaining a running score tally. The interface prevents accidental multiple clicks during animations to ensure fair play.
